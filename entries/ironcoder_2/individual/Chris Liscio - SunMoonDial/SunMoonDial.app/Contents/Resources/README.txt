SunMoonDial

This application replicates a "sun moon dial" as seen on some fancy watches, except at 1920x1200.  Of course, if you have a smaller monitor, it should look fine wherever it's run.  If it doesn't work well on your particular display, I'm sorry.

To run it, just launch SunMoonDial.app.  It requires the latest Tiger, and a Mac to run it on.  There's really no options or anything.  Just wait a minute if you want to notice any kind of rotation occurring.  :)

CoreGraphics was used for putting the images on the screen, rotating the dial, and masking the visible part of the dial onto your screen.

It's a neat effect, and probably something I'll run on my system for a while.  :)
