PURPOSE OF EXISTENCE
--------------------

At the end of the day, I often times wonder how time went by so fast. TimeLapse
takes a screenshot once in a while (7 seconds by default) and stores it. You can
then browse your screenshots later and try to figure out what the heck went
wrong.


HIGHLIGHTS
----------

- Screenshot taken using Core Graphics API

- A good example of super fast image resizing using the
  CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex call. The images are resized live. They are
  not cached or pre-scaled to thumbnail size. The screenshot sizes are limited
  to a width of 1024 pixels though just in case somebody runs this on the 30"
  cinema display.

- Tested with 1000+ screenshots.

- Click on the thumbnail image to see the full-sized image! On a separate Window!

- Live zoom-in and zoom-out

- Printing. Prints out a bunch of screenshot swatches.

- You can change the screenshot interval in the preferences

- Because JPEG compression is used for the images, recording a day of 14 hours
  taken at 1 minute intervals will only cost you 130 MB.

- Core Graphics based gradient drawing

- Universal Binary!


HINT
----
The images get stored in "~/Library/Application Support/TimeLapse/TimeLapse.dat".
Don't forget to delete it unless you like wasting hard drive space.


TODO
----

- Screenshots should be taken in a separate thread

- There are artifacts sometimes in the film's holes

- Core Data + NSArrayController's arrangedObjects is not good for memory
  efficiency. Need to release memory more aggressively.
