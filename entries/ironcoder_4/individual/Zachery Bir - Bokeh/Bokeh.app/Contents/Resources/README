From Wikipedia:

  Bokeh (from the Japanese boke ぼけ, "blur") is a photographic
  term describing the subjective aesthetic qualities of
  out-of-focus areas in an image produced by a camera lens.
  For example, causing an out-of-focus background image may
  reduce distractions and emphasize the primary subject.

  Although difficult to quantify, and hence open to debate,
  some lenses are believed to enhance overall image quality
  by producing more subjectively pleasing out-of-focus areas
  (bokeh). Bokeh is especially important for large-aperture
  lenses, macro lenses, and long telephoto lenses because they
  are typically used with a narrow depth of field. Bokeh is
  also important for "portrait lenses" (typically medium
  telephoto — 85–150 mm on 35-mm format) because the photographer
  would typically select a shallow depth of field (wide aperture)
  to have an out of focus background and make the subject stand
  out.

Bokeh tries to replicate this feel by providing the front-most
application with sharp focus, and rendering the remainder of
the screen blurred, but still recognizable.

Known Issues:
  - Uh, well, it actually doesn't do any blurring (despite my
    attempts at capturing the view behind each of Bokeh's windows
    and using that as the input image for the CIFilter). In the
    interim, it does make the windows slightly transparent, which
    has an accumulative effect the further back the windows are.
  - It doesn't properly interstice itself among all visible windows.
  - Occasionally, you'll need to bring a particular window forward
    twice to get it properly focused.
