Life Birds screen saver for Mac OS X
- for benefit of IronCoder V

Version 1.0, April 1, 2007

Written by Robert F. Pointon

------------------
About:

A screen saver!

Birds flock and when they land they then interact with Conway style life on the ground in such a way to ensure that life cells are always being created.

User can configure:
- the number of birds.
- whether the life is enabled on the ground.
- whether the background desktop is shown.
- whether the birds cast shadows.

------------------
Uniqueness factors:

Flocking and Life interacting together?
Realtime transparent background in an OpenGL screensaver? - slow, but hey..
Non-standard fade in effect?

------------------
System Requirements:

Universal, 10.4+

A semi-reasonable OpenGL card  (hmmm.. should check OpenGL capabilities)
