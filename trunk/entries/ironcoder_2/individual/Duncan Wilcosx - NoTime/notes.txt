This is a race against time game.

The main thread continuously displays stuff based on variables
shared with a background thread. The background thread updates
variables based on whatever is happening, keys pressed,
objects interacting, etc.

Graphics are loaded in CGLayers, that are blasted on screen as
needed.

This is the first game I write. I would do it quite differently
if I started from scratch, like making objects live a bit in the
backend and a bit in frontend, but it was fun to do.
