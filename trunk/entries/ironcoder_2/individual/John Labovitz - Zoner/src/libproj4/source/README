This file takes the place of a "configure" system which is
far too complex for this humble peon to figure out how to use.

Fortunately, the libproj4 system is easy to install and should
be quite portable across Unin, Linux operating systems.  Typical
sequence is to:

make libproj4
make lproj
make install

The last operation will probably require being in su mode.

Please examine the beginning of the Makefile and adjust the
names of the directories where you wish to install the compliled
library, program and header file.  THe defaults put everything
in the /usr/local limb of the tree.

                -----  N O T I C E -----

The Mayr projection requires the use of the Gnu Scientific Library
for the general case usage where the +n= option is employed.  The
distributed form of the Makefile excludes this option by commenting
out the line reading "GSL=1".  When the library is compiled in
this manner trying "+proj=mayr +n=" will cause a failure.  To enable
the full function of the mayr remove the # from the GSL=1 line before
compiling the library.  Note: when the library is compiled in this
manner any program using the library will also have to link with
the GSL library.

As always, please submit any bugs to the author at:

gerald.evenden@verizon.net

PS: the release/version of libproj4 is based upon the date that
forms the name of the distribution file and the name of a null
file in this directory.  Each program/header file will have its
own revision/date entry.
