Iron PacMan v1.0

Due to constraints of time and skillz, this is not a complete implementation of PacMan. To avoid shattered expectations:

  * There is no sound.
  * No hit testing is implemented. You won't eat dots or pills, but the ghosts won't kill you, either.
  * The side tunnels are not accessible.
  * There is a known glitch where you are only able to turn once you hit a wall; trying to turn before that will automatically "teleport" you to the end point.

Use the arrow keys to move.

Enjoy!
