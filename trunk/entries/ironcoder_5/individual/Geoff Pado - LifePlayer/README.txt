"Life Player" v. 0.5 by Geoff Pado released April 1st, 2007

Life Player is a screen saver, that, when run, browses the current user's iPhoto library and floats pictures across the screen.
As most people's photos are used as a journaling of their experiences, this screen saver plays back their life.

Double-click Life Player.saver to install Life Player. Select it in the "Desktop and Screen Saver" preference panel to use.

Known issues:
If used with a dual-monitor setup, one monitor will display a plain white square instead of an image.
