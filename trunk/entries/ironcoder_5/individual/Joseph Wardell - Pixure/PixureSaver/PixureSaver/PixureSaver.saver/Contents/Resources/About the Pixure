The pixure, or pixel creature, is a remarkable organism. Very closely related to the basic bacterium, it has no means of locomotion.  As such, it can only move by reproducing, which it does asexually whenever it is prompted to by its host computer.                                    
          
Pixures are tiny, never larger than one pixel. This of course means that the size of a pixure colony is limited to the size of the image in which the pixure colony resides.

The most remarkable thing about the pixure, though, is its tendency to want to replicate the color of the pixel that it lives above.  While some pixures are better at this than others, this ability seems somehow inextricably linked to the pixure's ability to survive and reproduce.  Somehow, pixures that are closer to the color where they live survive longer and produce more offspring, while pixures that don't blend well are quickly destroyed by their neightbors.

Yes, pixures are cannibals, willing at a moment's notice to devour neighboring pixures simply for the crime of not matching well enough.  This brutal adherence to fashion once led VH1 to attempt to recruit a colony of pixures to host their new show: "Best Long Talk about Clothes noone remembers Ever", but the pixures ignored the VH1 headhunters and instead took up root on the pile of cosmopolitan magazines piled in the VH1 waiting room.

Despite their apparent devotion to fashion, pixures seem to have no sense of aesthetics at all.  They simply copy what they see, or at least attempt to.  Since this author has already made one lame jab at modern television, this fact will go unremarked upon.
