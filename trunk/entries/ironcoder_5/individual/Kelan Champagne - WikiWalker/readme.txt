WikiWalker
version 1.0

WikiWalker is a screensaver that wanders through Wikipedia with a zoom/pan/fade effect.  It starts on the Life (disambiguation) page, and picks random links on each page to follow.  If you're lucky it might head towards the Meaning of life page, and then, who knows...


Warning: Its super crash-tastic right now, especially when trying to launch with the "Test" button in SystemPreferences (though the Preview does seem ok).  Please either load from the terminal with:
$ /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -module WikiWalker

or start it using a hot-corner.  And, even with all that, it still doesn't like multiple monitors.  Sorry about that.
