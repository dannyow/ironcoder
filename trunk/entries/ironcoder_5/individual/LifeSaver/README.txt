LifeSaver
=========

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) adapted to a Mac OS X screen saver -- written entirely in Python!

I went for a retro look & feel with the low-resolution 'board', and randomized the colors so that static blocks look a little bit more interesting (also, it was easier to go this route).

Instructions
============

To build & install in one shot, type 'sh build.sh'.  This should work on all Tiger systems, and it seemed to work on Leopard as well.  A pre-built version is found in the dist directory -- just double-click to install.

To use it, set your color and pattern preferences, run it, and be mesmerized.

This screen saver is based on code found at http://davidbau.com/archives/2006/07/26/python_curses_life.html by David Bau.

Patterns were lifted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life, and color schemes were generated by http://wellstyled.com/tools/colorscheme2/index-en.html.

The screen saver foundation was built on top of the Silly Balls example found on the PyObjC site.  Don't be surprised if you find any mention of Silly Balls lingering around anywhere in the code or the resources...
